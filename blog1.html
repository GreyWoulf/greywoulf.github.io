                            </a>
                            <p id="data"> Let us begin by redefining what a network is. To understand networking 
                                we have to break it down its defining components. So with that said,
                                what is a network? 
                                <br>
                                <blockquote>
                                "A network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources."
                                </blockquote>
                                <br>
                                Okay, so that definition was a lot to unwrap, so let's break it down even further. Look at the
                                word <strong><em>telecommunications</em></strong>. Well telecommunications allows you to communicate over a distance
                                via cable, phone, telegraph or broadcasting. Okay that was an easy one. Let's look at another
                                word, <strong><em>nodes</em></strong>. What the heck is that? A node in networking is the connection point among network 
                                devices such as routers, printers, clients or servers that can receive and send data from one endpoint 
                                to the other. So, so far we know a network is digital form of communication over a distance that
                                has connection points among other network devices to share resources.
                            </p>

                            <p id="data">
                                Okay, but wait you are probably thinking what are all those network devices that were just mentioned.
                                Well you are probably familiar with a router and a printer; moreso printer than router but we'll get
                                more into that one later along with others. I want to focus on the client and the server, which are 
                                also referred to as endpoints or endhosts. Those are key in networking. You will see those words
                                interchangeably throughout this reading.
                                <br><br>
                                A client is a device that access a service made available by a server. So let's take your computer 
                                for example. Right now your computer is accessing this blog made avaible by a web server, thus
                                making your computer a client. So things like computers, phones, etc are your typical clients in networking. 
                                <br><br>
                                A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients.
                                So, say you wanted to watch a youtube video, youtube provides the cloud service that delivers videos
                                to your device aka client. 
                                <br><br>
                                Let's do another client server example. Let's say you are at your computer
                                and someone from a different office requested a file from you from their computer. Who is the client 
                                and server in this scenario? Well your computer is the client and the other computer is the server. 
                                Since your computer is now the one sending data which is the file it is now considered a server, 
                                while the other computer is a client. A client can be a server as long as it provides a function or 
                                service to a client. Similarly the same device can be a client in some situations, and a server in 
                                other situations like when you are using your computer to watch youtube videos.
                                <br><br>
                                So with that all that in mind we can visualize a basic network. Two PCs or clients can be connected 
                                together via a cable creating a network and essentially have a conversation with each other. The 
                                examples above are considered more advanced networking systems.

                                The next network device we are going to talk about are switches. A switch provides local 
                                connectivity to hosts within the same LAN (Local Area Network). LANs are spaces such as 
                                    <strong>
                                    Home Office,
                                    Local Office, and
                                    Home.
                                    </strong>
                                Switches have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to. There are typically
                                24 connection ports on a switch.

                                Switches only work in a local setting and cannot provide connectivity between two Local
                                Area Networks such as a Home and an Office Space over the internet.
                                Looking at the below visual, you can see the switch can only provide 
                                network connectivity to the hosts that are connected to it. There is 
                                no transmission of data that can happen between switches over the internet.

                                    In this section we are returning back to a network device that we mentioned briefly before; routers.
                                    A router you have seen before, they have fewer interfaces than a switch and you use one in your house 
                                    all the time to connect to servers and send/receive data over the Internet. Routers are used to provide connectivity between 
                                    two LANs thus creating a WAN (Wide Area Network).

                                    The final network device that we are going to discuss today are firewalls. A firewall monitors
                                    and controls network traffic based on configured rules. You explicitly configure which network
                                    traffic should be allowed in your network and what should not. 
                                    <br>
                                    Firewalls can be placed inside the network, or outside of the network. These placements allow
                                    traffic to be filtered either before it reaches the router or after it has passed through the 
                                    router. In some cases you might have firewalls both inside and outside of the network.
                                    Just like any technology there are more advance options. A firewall comes in many different and/or advanced
                                    filtering capabilities. The firewalls that include more modern and advance filtering capabilities 
                                    are known as <em>"Next-Generation Firewalls."</em>

                                Today we defined a network and covered the core devices that make up a network. With all this 
                                information in mind, take a look at your own home/workspace setup and see if you can identify 
                                any of the network devices that we went over today. I hope you learned a lot and was able to
                                begin to understand at some fundamentals of a network. If you liked this post feel free to look
